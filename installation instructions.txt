Installing all of this together can be troublesome
you must install numpy before installing deeptrack!
tensorflow has version issues with tensorflow-addons and tensorflow-probability



method 3 - testing now
conda create -n deeptrack2 python=3.11.7
conda install numpy
pip install tensorflow==2.15.0
pip install deeptrack
pip install tensorflow-probability==0.23.0
pip install opencv-python
conda install spyder
*this one sort of works.... not sure yet

method 2 - testing now
conda create -n deeptrack python=3.11.7
conda install numpy
pip install deeptrack
pip install tf-keras
pip install opencv-python
pip install spyder
*works so far but i get a lot of warnings when it loads

method 1 - DOES NOT WORK
conda create -n deeptrack python=3.11.7
pip install deeptrack
pip install tf-keras
pip install opencv-python
pip install python-resources
** this did not work
